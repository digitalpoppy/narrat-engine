# Getting Help

## Narrat Forum

Please create a thread on the [help forum](https://narrat.discourse.group/c/help/5) with as much information as you can, including: Any logs if relevant, narrat version, browser used, description of the issue, and what you've attempted.

### Discord server

You can also ask for help [on Discord](https://discord.gg/Xgz7EQ2Xgh) if it's a small thing, but the forum is preferred as it's easier to keep track of issues and other people who have the same issue will be able to find that thread in the future.

### GitHub issues

It is also possible to open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/liana-p/narrat-engine/issues) to report a bug or suggest a feature.
